# HR_analycs_classification_with_Data_balancing

Classification on the HR dataset with imbalanced dataset. An imbalanced can lead to ambigious results where the overall accuray is high but the precision for minority class is very low. This is because the model is trained with more data beloging to the majority class and is bias towards it. A biased model will give less precision for the minority class.
The methods to solve imbalanced data are undersampling and oversampling.
